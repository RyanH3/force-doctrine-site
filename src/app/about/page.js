          <p>I have over a millennium of experience practicing and experimenting with the dark side of the Force.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>The most accurate modern translation of my name could be described as the sound of a dead tree falling in the forest. Most people, however, find that difficult to pronounce. Instead they use the name given to me by my acolytes, Tryphowon. I was born 26,000 years and 360 days Before the Battle of Yavin. From a young age, my family and I were taught to feel and move the Force.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>When I discovered the dark side, I asked my parents about it. They could only teach me its dangers, so I was mostly self-taught. Due to a carelessly executed technique, I was cursed with an extended life span and lost everyone I loved to time.</p>
